# Felix-The-Nous-FlexiWork-Savings-Calculator
The Flexiwork Savings Calculator is an online app that enables organizations to estimate a dollar figure on the benefits of offering employees the option to work flexibly (e.g. part-time, work-from-home, jobshare). It is an important part of the Victorian workplace gender equality strategy. I played a primary role in developing the underlying data model and building the app using R Shiny, along with my fantastic colleagues at Nous Group.  

Unfortunately I'm unable to publicly share the underlying code, but the app itself is available to use here: https://nousgroup.shinyapps.io/Felix_the_Nous_Flexiwork_Savings_Calculator.
